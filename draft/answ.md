Freedom 3: The freedom to redistribute copies of the program so you can help others.

2-How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

justifies the ethical importance of free software by asserting that software should empower users rather than limit them. Richard Stallman, in the manifesto, argues that proprietary software is a tool of control, where users become dependent on the softwareâ€™s creators, who restrict how the software can be used, modified, or shared. This monopolization creates unethical power imbalances. Free software, in contrast, gives users the ability to understand, modify, and share software, fostering collaboration, innovation, and user empowerment. Stallman emphasizes that ethical behavior in the digital age requires giving users freedom over their software to prevent exploitation.

3-What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
free software focus on the ethical and moral rights of the users to control the software they use,they can modify and make the code for themselves.
open source focuses on the benefits of the developers by improving the code and taking benefit of sharing the modifications in it.
