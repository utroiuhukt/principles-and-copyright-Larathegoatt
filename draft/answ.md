1-What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?

Freedom 1: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
Freedom 2: The freedom to study how the program works and to change it to make it do what you wish. 
Freedom 3: The freedom to redistribute copies of the program so you can help others.
Freedom 4: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

2-How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

justifies the ethical importance of free software by asserting that software should empower users rather than limit them. Richard Stallman, in the manifesto, argues that proprietary software is a tool of control, where users become dependent on the softwareâ€™s creators, who restrict how the software can be used, modified, or shared. This monopolization creates unethical power imbalances. Free software, in contrast, gives users the ability to understand, modify, and share software, fostering collaboration, innovation, and user empowerment. Stallman emphasizes that ethical behavior in the digital age requires giving users freedom over their software to prevent exploitation.

3-What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
free software focus on the ethical and moral rights of the users to control the software they use,they can modify and make the code for themselves.
open source focuses on the benefits of the developers by improving the code and taking benefit of sharing the modifications in it.


ETHICAL ESSAY
AI AND COPYRIGHT
The ethical dillema presented in this article is yhe copyright and how the big countries like china, USA , Rusia, etc are actually using 
a ilegal library with millions of documents "blocked" beacause copyrights 
The ethical problem here is how governments are using this type of documents with total liberty to improve his AI projects and try to win
against other countries who are using this "ilegal" data as well. meanwhile us the normal people have no access to this and if you do this
will be illegal.
this problem directly relates with the software libre principles with the users rights,freedom and transparency.
one of the software libre principles is the freedom to run,modify and distribute software which is fully obstaculed by the copyright blocking the ability to share knowledge to other people.
In the world of software libre, transparency is vital. Users must have access to source code and be able to understand how a system operates.
this archive alligns with transperency of software libre ensuring the critical and important information by not hiding it behind pays or licensing terms promoting an open and informed society and not just getting information for big companies and enterprises.
it seems to me that this make an indirect relation with improving users rights to free and various information.

MY STANCE ON THIS ISSUE 
in my view this issue could be confusing because it makes you question if the copyright politics are really useful or should be updated to the new world we are living in.
taking the the ideas of the document you see the artists might be affected by reducing the years of the copyright but at  the same time it help another causes by using his work to improve anything else
